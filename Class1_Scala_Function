Function are first class citizens:
----------------------------------------
> We can assign functions to a value.
> We can pass then as a parameter.
> We can return them from a high order function.

We can create values usign literal. Ex val s="Hello"

val l=5 | val l:Long=5 | val l=5:Long

can you create a function value using literal?



Anonymous Function
----------------------------
You don't have to give name to each function, just like we don't have to give a name to eac number.

(x: Double) => 3 * x

val triple = (x: Double) => 3 * x

This is equivalent to def triple(x: Double) = 3 * x


Closure in scala
----------------------------------
A Closure is a function. Like any other function a closure can be pure or impure.It can be named or unnamed. 

Example: 
def gethike(salary: Double)=salary*p/100

What is p here, P is a free variable here. It is not defined in the function.Function doesnot understand the value of P.

A Function that uses one or more free variable is know as closure.

where will copilerfind p? It looks for P in nearest local lexical  env where function was defined.We can decalre p outside the 
function.

val p=10
def gethike(salary: Double)=salary*p/100

Closure takes the recent value of P i.e it takes recent value of free varaible.

Q)Is closure Pure?
Ans: No closure is not pure.As free varaible is Var. If varaible is val then it is pure.
Closure cna be pure or impure depending on the varaible declared as either val or var.

Q)How does a change in the value of free variable impact the closure?

Q)What happens when closure modifies the free variable?
Ans:If closure sets the free variable the changes are seen outside the closure.

Q)Why closure? What are the benefits?
In function programming we can pass function and return functions.
