What is Trait in scala?
-----------------------------------
A trait is like an interface with a partial implementation. In scala, trait is a collection of abstract and non-abstract methods. 
You can create trait that can have all abstract methods or some abstract and some non-abstract methods.

If a class extends a trait but does not implement the members declared in that trait, it must be declared abstract. Let's see an example

If a class implements multiple traits, it will extend the first trait, class, abstract class. 
with keyword is used to extend rest of the traits.

trait Printable{  
    def print()  
}  
  
trait Showable{  
   def show()  
}  
  
class A6 extends Printable with Showable{  
    def print(){  
        println("This is printable")  
    }  
    def show(){  
        println("This is showable");  
    }  
}  

use "extends" keyword to extend first trait then use "with" keyword for other trait
