An object is a type of class that can have no more than one instance, known in object oriented
design as a singleton
Instead of creating an instance with a new keyword, just
access the object directly by name. An object gets automatically instantiated the first
time it is accessed in a running JVM, which also means that until it is accessed the first
time it wonâ€™t get instantiated.

An object can extend another class,
making its fields and methods available in a global instance. The reverse is not true,

Syntax: Defining an Object
object <identifier> [extends <identifier>] [{ fields, methods, and classes }]

Traits
A trait is a kind of class that enables multiple inheritance. Classes, case classes, objects,
and (yes) traits can all extend no more than one class but can extend multiple traits at
the same time.
